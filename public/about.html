  <h1 style="text-align: center;">About Me</h1>
  <p>Hello! I’m a passionate data enthusiast with a strong academic foundation in computer applications and science. 
    I completed my Master of Computer Applications (MCA) from NCRD's Sterling Institute of Management Studies, Mumbai, 
    and hold a Bachelor of Science (BSc) from a college affiliated with Shivaji University, Kolhapur.</p>

  <p>During my academic journey, I discovered my knack for data analytics and problem-solving. One of my key projects, 

  "Bank Analytics," involved leveraging tools like Power BI and Tableau to analyze loan data and customer trends, 
  providing actionable insights to optimize business decisions. I thrive on turning raw data into meaningful stories 
  that drive growth and innovation.</p>

  <p>When I’m not exploring data, I enjoy embracing new challenges, learning emerging technologies, and contributing to 
    projects that make an impact. With a mix of technical expertise and a results-oriented mindset, I’m always looking 
    to collaborate on ideas that create value.</p>
